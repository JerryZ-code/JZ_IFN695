A credible contingency event during this planned outage could leave South Australia connected to the NEM only via the South Australian 132 kV network. To maintain system security following this contingency AEMO will need to: 
• Initiate the orderly separation of SA from the rest of the NEM.               
• Source increased local regulation FCAS within SA.

During this planned outage power transfer will be restricted across the Victoria - South Australia interconnector (Heywood interconnector). ",Day: NA-Night: NA,In Progress - PTP,"In Progress - PTP
